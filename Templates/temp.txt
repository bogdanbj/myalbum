After joining the Hudson's Bay Company in 1750, Henday undertook an expedition to draw Prairie Indians into trade with the Company on Hudson Bay. In 1754, he travelled up the Hayes River and across the prairies between the North and South Saskatchewan rivers to reach the site of Red Deer, Alberta. He may have seen the Rockies from there.

Trained as map-maker under Captain James Cook, Vancouver undertook a round-the-world voyage from 1791 to 1795, covering 105,000 kilometres. He surveyed the west coast from 30o to 60o N., and was so intent on mapping the coastline that he missed the Columbia River. Nevertheless, he would eventually dispel the myth that a Northwest Passage existed at these latitudes.

As a partner in the North West Company, Fraser led an expedition in 1805 to explore the Upper Peace River and establish trading posts. In 1808, he explored the river that was later to bear his name, though at the time he thought it was the Columbia. He ignored the Indians' warnings about boiling rapids and towering cliffs, and narrowly escaped death in Hell's Gate canyon. Cowichan Indians prevented him from reaching the coast.

An explorer and avid hunter, Palliser headed the "Palliser Expedition" which, from 1857 to 1861, explored the plains north of the 49th parallel and the passes through the Rockies. The expedition delineated a stretch of semi-arid land named "Palliser's Triangle", and the surrounding, "fertile belt" which was found suitable for stock raising and agriculture.
